## Overview

Fun-Kollection ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our Funko Pop collection tracking mobile application.

## Information We Collect

**We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.**

### Data Stored Locally on Your Device

The app stores the following information **exclusively on your device**:

- **Funko Collection Data**: Names, series, numbers, categories, conditions, sizes, types, variants, purchase prices, current values, purchase dates, and notes about your Funko Pops
- **Photos**: Images you take or select from your photo library to associate with your Funko Pops
- **App Settings**: Your preferences and configuration within the app

All data is stored locally using:
- SQLite database on your device
- Local file system for images
- No cloud synchronization or external storage

## How We Use Your Information

Your data is used solely to:
- Display your Funko collection within the app
- Allow you to add, edit, search, and delete Funko Pops from your collection
- Provide collection statistics and insights
- Enable you to share individual Funko cards via your device's native share functionality

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

**We do NOT:**
- Share your data with third parties
- Sell your data to advertisers

- Track your usage or behavior
- Collect analytics or telemetry
- Use cookies or tracking technologies

**Optional Sharing by You:**
- You may choose to share individual Funko card images using your device's native share sheet (Messages, Email, Social Media, etc.)
- When you share, the data goes directly to the app/service you select—we do not intercept or store this information

The app does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

**Expo Services:**
- The app is built using Expo framework

**Important:** If you uninstall the app, all local data will be deleted. We recommend backing up your device regularly.

## Children's Privacy

Fun-Kollection does not knowingly collect any information from children. The app does not require users to provide any personal information. Since Funko Pop collecting is enjoyed by all ages, the app is designed to be family-friendly.
